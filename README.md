# Sample Repo for DevOps

## Overview

Welcome to the **Sample Repo for DevOps**! This repository demonstrates how various DevOps tools are used in a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The tools covered include AWS, Maven, Linux, Terraform, Jenkins, and more, with a focus on automating infrastructure, building, and deploying applications in a seamless and efficient way.

## DevOps Tools Used

### ![AWS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg) **AWS**
AWS provides scalable cloud infrastructure, enabling easy deployment and management of resources. This project leverages AWS services to handle hosting, computing, storage, and more.

### ![Maven](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Apache_Maven_logo.svg) **Maven**
Apache Maven is used for automating the build process. It handles dependencies, compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application, ensuring that the build process is consistent and efficient.

### ![Linux](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Linux_logo.svg) **Linux**
The project runs on Linux-based servers, ensuring reliability and performance. Linux is the ideal environment for handling production workloads with efficiency and scalability.

### ![Terraform](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Terraform_Logo.svg) **Terraform**
Terraform is used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision, manage, and automate the infrastructure. It ensures that the infrastructure is consistent and easily replicable across different environments.

### ![Jenkins](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Jenkins_logo.svg) **Jenkins**
Jenkins is used for automating the CI/CD pipeline. It integrates with various tools like GitHub, Maven, and Terraform to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring continuous delivery of updates.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following tools installed and configured on your local machine:

- **AWS CLI**: For interacting with AWS services.
- **Docker**: To build and run containerized applications.
- **Terraform**: For managing infrastructure as code.
- **Jenkins**: To run and manage CI/CD pipelines.
- **Maven**: For building and packaging Java applications.
- **Linux-based OS or WSL (for Windows users)**: For running the project in a Unix-like environment.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sample-devops-repo.git
   cd sample-devops-repo
